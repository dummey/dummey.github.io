The ride out to the southern terminus with Stella was peaceful. the drive is the same as going to the boulevard road race, so it was a good helping nostalgia.

the one problem is that my debit card is locked because of the conversion to chip. so half the ride was spent on the phone with a surprisingly good support. so I got to pay my credit card bill before I started! and forgot the card in the car... probably.

took the customary monument and fence picture

meet Greg and Kristen(?) at the start. we would leak frog a couple times during the day. Kristen
is a Cal eecs grad, so lily, I found one of your pupils!

I found a good group of people to hike with. I'm not as fast, but steady enough to catch them at breaks. 

the day was hot with exposed climbs. every chance of shade was taken with great relief.

though I did not need the full 9.5 liters of water. did give some away though

camped at lake Morena with a big group of other hikers.

got burger and beer! accidentally threw away the trail mix I bought though... and lost my wallet on the way to the showers.

I got my trail name, Data.
