There has always been an interesting relationship between technology and the outdoors. Some go the purist route eschewing their devices when out in the wild. Others carry all the creature comforts that can be stuffed into their bag. And for me and my pursuits in ultra-endurance adventures, a healthy moderation. 

For the Trans Am Bike Race in 2014, I rode from Astoria, OR to Yorktown, VA covering 4600 miles in 30 days (about 140 miles per day). Along the way, I used convention technology such as Garmin GPS units and smart phones. But I also used unconventional technology such as crawlers, aggregators, and machine learning to create a virtual advisor.

This allowed me to have current, relevant information without the problem of information overload. Because the last thing I wanted was indecision paralysis and sleep deprivation.
