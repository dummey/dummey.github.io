got shuttled in the morning by danger muffin to San Bernardino where we got into the shuttle service up to big bear lake. the danger muffin ride was relaxing. the shuttle ride made me want to puke.

smoosh may of unzipped a jacket causing Windows to be immediately opened, we don't smell good.

at big bear lake, we resupplied out of the Vons. it is my first time! 

we also may of gotten lunch there and relaxed. it was such a nice day. I also grab a tribute beer for the trail :-) 

as we were walking to the bus stop, we got some trail luck in getting rides to the trail head. at least those of us aside from Zack and Batman who lost the even or odd game

Buffalo bill was my ride, super relaxing 

on the trail, we hiked 9 miles in to a large campsite next to a small stream.

the walk went by fast. some rock trails, but not too many.
