camped with smoosh and tip toe in a nice sheltered area 5 miles out from the Julian road crossing. 

morning hike was pleasant in the cool. water cache was empty but we all had more than enough water to make it. I believe we each sink up to 2 liters before starting the climb which would take most of the day.

the views while climbing were just gorgeous. the grade even and mild. a few to many rocks for my sore feet which ached.

a long siesta was taken at 3rd gate cache before hiking a bit more to a mountain top campsite with a great view.
