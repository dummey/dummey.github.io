rainy and cold last night. low of 38. why is my ass so chilly?

had to stay in the tent so long because it was wet and Mt Laguna isn't open until right according to the guide

hiking at my own pace, got fake lost at the campground and took the longer easy into town. meet good guy Derrick and hiked into town together

breakfast was had at Pine Lodge. sausage quiche and way too much coffee. I also got some additional did from the outfitter because I was easy to optimistic about my page starting out.

the group debated about whether to continue our to zero in town. it looked like a zero at the lodge... but the weather let up as the day went on and after late margaritas to celebrate cinco de Mayo, we headed out another six miles to MN t Laguna campground where I am now writing this.

we even got a fire going to warm the soul.

the six mile hike was filled with ridge walking and wrong, but the view was gorgeous. visibility for miles at mountain ranges speed by dancing sunlight peaking through the clouds reaching across the sky.

and to make sure this is not forgotten, today was a Blondie day. no lighter. no idea how to cook freeze dried dinners. linelocs on backwards. had to buy new shoes in town.
