slept in, the fold out futon was surprisingly comfortable. dropped off laundry for 5$. had a breakfast burrito at Red Kettle, delicious. had plenty of time to check my food bag, grab groceries which was across the street before the noon checkout time.

watched Capt America civil war at the one room theatre in town. was like five people during our 2pm maintee showing.

moved to the campground tonight which is cheap, 3$ a night. met Nate who is a college friend of smoosh. went back to LA placita Mexican place for yummy food. 

camping here is not the best, close to the road where the sounds of cars bleed in. and not much in the way of flat ground, but I have a cozy cowboy spot
