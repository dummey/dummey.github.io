This whole blogging while on the trail is so hard to do. By the time I get into camp and have everything setup, I can't help but fall asleep while staring at my screen. So maybe I'll do this writing while in town thing a bit more.

I am currently in Tehachipi chilling at the Best Western. It's not to be clean from the desert dust which seems to have a talent for invading every square inch of skin. We, Team Motherload, came in on the 30th and spent the first night camped at the airport park which had grass! Grass is amazing! It's soft, keeps dirt and soil down, and is not desert colored. 

The campground also has a converted port-a-potty shower system with what looks like an on demand water heater. It's pretty spacious inside and while the temperature can't be controlled, it was perfect. 

The following two days will be spent at the Best Western.
