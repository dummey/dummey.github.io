Off we go at 5 AM to try and beat the heat of the day. It is about an hour from San Diego to the southern terminus in Campo, CA. 

One of the benefits of coming from the central time zone of that I get a 2 hour headstart when walking up :-) 

My pack is close to 40 lbs right now. 13 lbs base, 6 lbs food, and 21 lbs of water (9 liters). 

A bit more water than most, but I can always drink a bit more or wash my face.
