What is the TABR(Trans America Bike Race) some of you may be asking? It is a cycling race put on every year from Astoria, Oregon to Yorktown, Virgina using the ACA Route. It is ~4300 miles long adventure that both cost surprisingly little and a lot.

There will be a select few of you reading this who’s heart are starting to rapidly beat from the allure of this adventure. These are the cost breakdowns for my 31 day race.
