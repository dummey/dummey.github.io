May 3rd marks the last day that I will be in St Louis for a while. The last week passed by in a blur and for anybody looking to go on a big adventure, I highly advice against imitating my chaotic schedule. 

It involved life centered around packing with breaks every so often taken for eating with friends. My guess is that I made 50 trips up and down the elevators (I lived on the 6th floor). With 20 trips to the Schinerman household where they have graciously allowed me to invade their basement. And the Wagner's for car sitting.

There was a total of 30ish boxes, 4 complete bikes, and 3 incomplete bikes. this took about 80 actual hours of packing (with some haphazard tossing of items into bags).

It was stressful, highly not recommended.

On the passive side though are all the awesome people that spent time with me before I left. The Launchcode community, my St Louis Tri Club teammates, coworkers from WashU, and probably others that I am forgetting about at this moment. 

In 5 months, I will be back with some new stories for you St Louis!
