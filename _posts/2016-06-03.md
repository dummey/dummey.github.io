we are finally leaving tehatchipi! the fire information has is feeling safe enough hiking up to Walker pass. what happens from there we won't know, but at least this next section is finally being started.

this town has been great though. it is not as tightly packed as idyllwild, but everything is in walking distance (just barely).

we stayed at the airport park the first night, then splurged on best Western the following 3 days, the last day being a reaction to the fire just breaking out.

resupply happened at the Albertsons, though I bought a couple days too much now that our plan is to reevaluate at Walker pass. 

and the hunt for a chrome cast has failed in this town, nobody has one. 

the food in this town had been great too. red house BBQ had some delicious food. the sushi place Midori was the site of some sake bombs. tk pizza has 4$ draft beers. the bakery has delicious sandwiches

we are now waiting in the park waiting for the wonderful trail angel Wilma to shuttle us back to the trailhead.
