for once I was not cold! we camped at the boat picnic area along lake Silverton.

we also ask slept in a bit leaving at 6ish. it was 15 miles to McDonald. I know that most people have their minds made up about the place, but while trail hungry, it is amazing.

the first 10 miles out from camp went by quickly with some climbs over the mountains surrounding I 10. the second set of five miles seemed to take forever though. it involved a lot of ridge walking and just winding around the landscape
 I think the lack of obvious targets make it drag on 

at McDonald, I got a double quarter lber, 2 mcchicken, 2 mcdoubled and a yogurt parfait. I packed out the non quarter and parfait for dinner

I left before the group to do the last 5. it was such a nice change to arrive early and have plenty of time to just relax and pick my site.

the ground was a bit sandy, may some something to do with the fact that we were on the San Andreas fault. this combined with the high winds made from a very dusty night
