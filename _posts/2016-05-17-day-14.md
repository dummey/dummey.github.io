the moon was so bright that it was as if a light had been left on in the tent.

somebody, possibly more than one person, may have been snoring the whole night

I may have also frozen because it was a low of 31 degrees. I am so excited to get my sleeping bag in wrighrwood, thanks linds

started the day at 6:15, a bit later than most others in the pack

the morning was peaceful with chilly sections where the wind blew through the burn area

had lunch with hippie and bourbon

camping next to the river at 298.5
